        <h2><strong>What is Forward Flow?</strong></h2>
        <p>
          <strong><em>A Stream of Consciousness.</em></strong> Each of us
          possesses a stream of consciousness, a steady flow of thoughts that
          define our mental life. This naturalistic stream is hard to capture,
          but has been assessed with free association, in which people
          sequentially list their thoughts. Unfortunately, free association is a
          qualitative task that seems hard to quantify.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>An Analytic Technique.</em></strong> However, latent
          semantic analysis (LSA) provides a way to quantify the conceptual
          content of naturalistic thought. LSA computes the semantic distance
          between two words by examining how often they appear together within
          texts. For example, “snow” and “white” have a small semantic distance
          (they are close in meaning), whereas “snow” and “carburetor” have a
          large semantic distance.

          <strong><em>Forward Motion in Thought</em></strong>

        <p>
          Forward flow is the average semantic distance between any given
          thought and all previous thoughts. It can be understood as the ability
          for a stream of consciousness to flow forward, leaving behind previous
          thoughts. Low forward flow is when thoughts circle back to previous
          thoughts (e.g., happy, smile, dentist, teeth, smile, happy); high
          forward flow is when thoughts continue to flow away from the past
          (e.g., happy, smile, dentist, doctor, hospital, helicopter).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Forward Flow and Creativity.</em></strong> Our work
          suggests that this forward motion in naturalistic thought predicts
          creativity. People with higher forward flow give more creative answers
          to standard creativity tasks, and those with creative careers (e.g.,
          actors, entrepreneurs) have higher forward flow than the general
          population.

        <p>
          Forward flow provides a way to graph people's stream of thought—via
          the thought plot.
